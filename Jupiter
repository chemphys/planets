# Jupiter
The planets equatorial clouds take 18 hours to complete one rotation. The
reason this happens is that Neptune does not have a solid body.

The large red spot on the world is a hurricane that has raged for at least hundreds of years. 

Like Saturn, it also has rings. They are very faint, though.

## Moons
Jupiter 67 moons: Ganymede Callisto Io Europa

Europa is special, as it has a frozen surface.
